# Robotics Autonomy Sim — A* Path Planner + Pure Pursuit Controller on Grid World for Diff. Drive Robot (MVP)

This repo is a lightweight 2D Python + Matplotlib simulation for me to familiarize myself on various elements of closed-loop non-holonomic mobile robotics including planning, controls and state estimation.


## Run

```bash
python3 -m scripts.run_simulation --visualize_detailed
```
